Template repository to quickstart library development.

## Usage

This template uses an installer to setup all the files that need replacing of placeholders but most files
are just kept as they are.

TODOs:
1. Create the new repository on GitHub using this repository as template
1. Add protection rules for master and release branches since they are not copied from the template :(
1. Clone the new repository to local
1. Run the installer by executing `composer run-installer`
1. Add and commit your files and push them to remote
1. Submit the new package to packagist
1. Get to work! ;)
