Template repository to quickstart library development.

## Usage

This template uses an installer to setup all the files that need replacing of placholders but most files
are just kept as they are.

TODOs:
1. Create the new repository on GitHub using this repository as template
2. Clone the new repository to local
3. Run the installer by executing `composer run-installer`
4. Add and commit your files and push them to remote
5. Submit the new package to packagist
6. Get to work! ;)
